## Description:
This is a React application that allows a user to search for videos from the Youtube API. The user can input the name of video to search, and then view the list of results on the right side. The user does not need to press Enter to search. The search function runs 30 sec after the last key press. The selected video plays in the player. See the [usage](#usage) or [demonstration](#demonstration) sections for a more detailed explanation on how to use this application.

This application was created using _ReactJS_, as well as _React Hooks_ (_useState_ and _useEffect_), and LocalStorage.
